# STEM-MESA — San Bernardino Valley College

## Welcome

The **STEM-MESA Program** offers STEM students free tutoring and Supplemental Instruction (SI) sessions throughout the academic year to support study habits, academic goals, and career exploration. It also offers a range of workshops, STEM-related activities, on-campus events, and field trips.  
The **Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA)** program builds academic peer communities to boost support and motivation. It's a vigorous prep engine for students pursuing science, engineering, and math degrees, preparing them for transfer to four-year institutions. California MESA at the community college level fosters a diverse, transfer-ready population of students. Most MESA events are open to SBVC students, faculty, and staff.  
Students who meet eligibility requirements are encouraged to apply to become MESA members.
