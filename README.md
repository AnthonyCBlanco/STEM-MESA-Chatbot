SBVC STEM-MESA RAG Chatbot
A high-speed, low-cost RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot designed to answer student questions about the STEM-MESA Center at San Bernardino Valley College.

This application leverages the blazing-fast Groq API with the Llama 3.1 8B model to provide instant, accurate, and context-aware answers based on a local knowledge base of documents.

✨ Features
Blazing-Fast Responses: Powered by the Groq Llama 3.1 LLM, providing near-instant answers.

Accurate & Grounded: Uses a RAG pipeline to ensure answers are based only on the documents you provide, minimizing hallucinations.

Source Citations: The chatbot cites the source documents used to generate an answer, providing transparency and trust.

Extremely Low Cost: Built with a cost-effective tech stack that makes it affordable to run and scale.

Simple & Modern UI: A clean, responsive web interface for easy interaction.

Easy to Update: Simply add or change documents in the vault/ folder and re-run the ingestion script to update the chatbot's knowledge.

⚙️ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

A free Groq API Key

2. Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/sbvc-mesa-chatbot.git](https://github.com/your-username/sbvc-mesa-chatbot.git)
cd sbvc-mesa-chatbot

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Groq API key:

GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_YourSecretGroqApiKeyGoesHere"

4. Add Your Documents
Place your knowledge base files (.pdf, .txt) into the vault/ directory. If this folder doesn't exist, create it.

mkdir vault
# Now add your files into the vault/ folder

Examples: tutoring_schedule.pdf, workshop_info.txt, etc.

5. Ingest the Data
Run the ingestion script to process your documents. This will create a data/ directory containing the vector index and metadata.

You must run this script every time you add, change, or remove documents in the vault/ directory.

python ingest.py

6. Run the Application
Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

uvicorn app:app --reload

🖥️ Usage
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000

You can now start asking questions in the chat interface!
